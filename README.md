# Minimalist video player

Minimalist video player for Vimeo, Youtube or any other video services using iframes.

- progressively enhances a link to a video wrapped around an image
- allows for custom responsive cover image and play button
- does not load `iframe` elements during initial page load
- uses JS modules and `template` support as cut the mustard test
- allows for multiple players on the same page
